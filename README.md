![Faded Prism Logo](res/faded-prism-logo.png)

A pastel color theme by Ryan Brue! Works great with all sorts of languages!

## Motivation

I really like the One Dark Pro theme, but I felt like the colors were switched from what I would expect for each type of symbol. I felt like this coloring made more sense to me:

- Red for keywords
- Yellow for strings
- Green for functions
- Blue for types and classes

Using this simple framework, the rest of the features came naturally.
